teamboard-feedback
==================

As techniques for getting feedback more efficiently and making the process fluent, the teamboard feedback channel utilizes Uservoice, Zapier and Github. The feedback is sent from teamboard with the Uservoice widget and then processed/answered by what has been specified in the widget's 'Type' field. Bug reports are directed to Github as issues with the help of Zapier.

About using the Uservoice widget
--------------------------------

The widget in teamboard is made to be used with a directive, which has been extended from the Uservoice trigger directive authored by [chesleybrown](https://github.com/chesleybrown/uservoice-trigger-directive). The added options (alongside mode, position and indentify) are color, width and height of the widget and whether smartvote is enabled or not. If these properties are unset, defaults are used instead.
